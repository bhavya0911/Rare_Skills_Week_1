# ERC777 and ERC1363: Addressing Limitations of ERC20

## ERC777: Enhancing Token Functionality

ERC777 was introduced to solve several limitations of the ERC20 standard:

1. **Lack of event emission on minting and burning**: ERC777 mandates events for these operations, improving transparency.

2. **Two-step transfer process**: Unlike ERC20's separate `approve` and `transferFrom` calls, ERC777 introduces a single `send` function.

3. **Lost tokens**: ERC777 includes hooks to prevent accidental token loss when sending to contracts.

4. **Limited functionality**: ERC777 allows for additional data to be included with transfers, enabling more complex token interactions.

5. **Backward compatibility**: ERC777 maintains compatibility with ERC20, allowing for easier adoption.

### Issues with ERC777

Despite its improvements, ERC777 has faced some challenges:

1. **Reentrancy vulnerabilities**: The hooks in ERC777 can potentially be exploited for reentrancy attacks if not carefully implemented.

2. **Gas cost**: The additional functionality of ERC777 can lead to higher gas costs compared to simpler ERC20 transactions.

3. **Complexity**: The added features make ERC777 more complex to implement and audit correctly.

4. **Adoption challenges**: Due to security concerns and complexity, ERC777 has seen limited adoption compared to ERC20.

## ERC1363: Payable Token

ERC1363 was introduced to address a specific limitation of ERC20:

1. **Callback on transfer**: ERC1363 allows for executing code after a transfer or approval, enabling "payable" tokens.

### Key features of ERC1363:

1. **Single transaction actions**: Combines transfer/approval and contract execution in one transaction.

2. **Simplified integration**: Makes it easier to accept tokens as a payment method in smart contracts.

3. **Backward compatibility**: Fully compatible with ERC20, allowing for gradual adoption.

4. **Gas efficiency**: Generally more gas-efficient than ERC777 for similar use cases.

5. **Security**: Simpler to implement and audit compared to ERC777, potentially reducing vulnerability risks.

## Conclusion

While both ERC777 and ERC1363 aim to enhance token functionality beyond ERC20, they take different approaches:

- ERC777 offers a more comprehensive overhaul with hooks and improved events but faces challenges in security and adoption.
- ERC1363 focuses on a specific use case (callback on transfer) and offers a simpler, more targeted solution.

The choice between these standards depends on the specific requirements of a project, with ERC1363 often being preferred for its simplicity and security in cases where its functionality suffices.
